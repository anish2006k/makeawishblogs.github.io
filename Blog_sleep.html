                <p>
                    We see people working at day and taking rest at night. Even most of us work at day and sleep at
                    night. There are around only 6.5% of the world's population that work all the night and sleep out
                    all the day?? Have we ever asked ourselves that why do we sleep at night and work in the day time???
                    Actually there are many reasons behind this, following are the major ones:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="main_content">
                <p>
                    - Our brain usually releases melatonin at night time, melatonin is a hormone which makes us
                    sleepy,
                    and this hormone is reactive to darkness, therefore when it becomes dark our brain, starts
                    releasing
                    melatonin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Next point, is that our brain doesn't much melatonin in the day time therefore, most of us
                    doesn't
                    feel much sleepy during day time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Our brain has a system called the circadian biological clock which tells us that it's the time
                    of
                    sleep or it's the time to wake up, and as we work very much at day, the circadian biological
                    clock
                    tells us that it's time to sleep and then we go to bed. It is also responsible for waking up us
                    at
                    day time. We have observed that when we sleep late at night, we wake also late in the morning,
                    this
                    is because the circadian biological clock always wake us up after around 6-8 hours of sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Our brain has another mechanism called SCN which responds to the ligth received by our eyes.
                    Whenever it becomes night, SCN signals our circadian biological clock that it is the time to
                    sleep,
                    and when our eye receives the first daylight, it signals the circadian biological clock that it
                    is
                    the time to wake us up. SCN can also operate the melatonin levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Other than our body needs, there also many health issues like, sunlight gives us positivity
                    and
                    vitamin-D, and lack of sleep during night time can lead to health issues like anxiety, stress,
                    headaches etc...
