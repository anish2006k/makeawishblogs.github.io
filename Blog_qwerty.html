                <p>
                    When we type on our laptops or in our mobiles we can see that the keypad layout is not in the format
                    of
                    the usual Alphabetic order, but it is in the format of random letters in different places. This
                    layout
                    is called "QWERTY". Many of you will ponder that why do we use This difficult layout instead of
                    using
                    the normal ABCD layout. For those let me tell you that the old keyboard layout was in the normal
                    ABCD
                    format but then it was changed. The reason being, people were very used to that layout and therefore
                    they were typing so fast that the keys started fluctuating. Therfore the layout was changed to
                    QWERTY so
                    that peoplw would take time to learn that layout. Hope you enjoyed this post.
